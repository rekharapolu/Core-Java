Here are some sample answers to commonly asked interview questions for a software engineer role:

1. Data Structures and Algorithms
Q1: Explain the differences between arrays and linked lists.
Answer:

Array:
Fixed size; defined at the time of declaration.
Contiguous memory allocation.
Access time is O(1) for indices, but insertion/deletion takes O(n).
Linked List:
Dynamic size; can grow or shrink at runtime.
Non-contiguous memory allocation; nodes are connected via pointers.
Insertion/deletion is O(1) at the head but requires O(n) traversal for specific positions.
Q2: Write a program to find the maximum subarray sum.
Kadane's Algorithm:

python
Copy code
def max_subarray_sum(nums):
    max_sum = nums[0]
    current_sum = nums[0]

    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
    return max_sum

# Example
nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
print(max_subarray_sum(nums))  # Output: 6 (subarray: [4, -1, 2, 1])
Q3: Explain hashmaps and how collisions are handled.
Answer:
A hashmap stores key-value pairs and provides O(1) average-time complexity for lookups and insertions. Collisions occur when two keys hash to the same index.

Collision Handling Techniques:
Chaining: Store multiple key-value pairs at the same index using a linked list.
Open Addressing: Probe for the next available slot using techniques like linear probing or quadratic probing.
2. SQL
Q4: Write an SQL query to fetch the second-highest salary from an employee table.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
Q5: Explain the differences between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN.
Answer:

INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.
LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. Rows without a match in the right table will have NULL values for the right table's columns.
3. Object-Oriented Programming
Q6: What is the Singleton Design Pattern?
Answer:
The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance.
Example in Python:

python
Copy code
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
4. System Design
Q7: Design a URL shortener like Bitly.
Answer:

Key Components:
Frontend: Interface to input the URL.
Backend:
Generate a unique short URL (e.g., base62 encoding).
Store short URL and corresponding long URL in a database.
Database: Store mappings between short and long URLs.
Cache: Frequently accessed short URLs are cached for faster lookups.
Scalability: Use load balancers and sharding for large datasets.
5. Behavioral Questions
Q8: Tell me about a challenging project you worked on.
Answer:
"In my final-year project, I worked on developing a traffic signal optimization system using IoT devices. A major challenge was ensuring real-time data collection and processing from multiple sensors. I overcame this by implementing multithreading in Python for concurrent data processing and used MQTT protocol for efficient communication. The project reduced average signal wait times by 20% during testing."

6. Advanced Topics
Q9: What is the difference between REST and SOAP?
Answer:

REST:
Lightweight and faster.
Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
Supports various data formats like JSON, XML.
SOAP:
Heavyweight with strict standards.
Relies on XML for data exchange.
Provides built-in error handling and security.
